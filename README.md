# FDTD Simulation of Optical NAND Gate

This code supports the FDTD simulation results presented in 2019 paper "Digital signal processing in coupled photonic crystal waveguides and its application to an all-optical AND logic gate". The paper is available [online](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11082-019-1833-9).

# Code

Main simulation script is `NAND_Full_Simulation_SC.m`. The file is supposed to be run top-to-bottom, in MatLab.
